        <section name="JMAP configuration">

            <p><a href="https://jmap.io/">JMAP</a>  is intended to be a new standard for email clients to connect to mail
                stores. It therefore intends to primarily replace IMAP + SMTP submission. It is also designed to be more
                generic. It does not replace MTA-to-MTA SMTP transmission.</p>

            <p>Cassandra Guice proposes a JMAP implementation.</p>

            <subsection name="jmap.properties">

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/jmap.properties">jmap.properties</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>Enabling <b>TRACE</b> on <b>org.apache.james.jmap.wire</b> enables reactor-netty wiretap, logging of
                all incoming and outgoing requests, outgoing requests. This will log also potentially sensible information

            <subsection name="JMAP-draft vs JMAP-RFC-8621">
                <p>James had been supporting an implementation based on an early specification of JMAP, what we call here
                <em>JMAP-draft</em> version. But the protocol went under a lot of changes until its finalization as an
                official RFC.</p>

                <p>The finalized version of JMAP regarding the core specifications [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8620">RFC-8620</a>]
                and the mail specifications [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8621">RFC-8621</a>] are being
                currently implemented in James (<em>JMAP-RFC-8621</em> version). It's supposed to replace at term the
                <em>JMAP-draft</em> version.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, both versions will be available. The version by default will be <em>JMAP-draft</em> during
                the time it takes to implement the new version. If you want to use a specific version for a request,
                you will need to add an extra <em>jmapVersion</em> field in your <b>Accept</b> header of your JMAP request:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>JMAP-draft</b>: <em>Accept: application/json; jmapVersion=draft</em></li>
                    <li><b>JMAP-RFC-8621</b>: <em>Accept: application/json; jmapVersion=rfc-8621</em></li>
                </ul>
